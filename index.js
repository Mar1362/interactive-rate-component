var submit = document.querySelector('button'); // we retrieve the submit button in order to handle the click after
/*
 it is because we have only one section, one button and one list
 at the HTML that we can retrieve them like this. So, if the HTML
 code change we may have to handle it back here. That is why the best
 way to retrieve elements from the HTML is by using their id but 
 since this is a small challenge so we keep it easy ;)

        Remark: this code is to avoid on big projects because 
        we do not consider if the element had some class affected
        to it before (and fortunately it don't).
        you can ask how that could be done by commenting at the feedback section.
        i'll be glad to answer
